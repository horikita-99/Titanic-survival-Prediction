# Titanic-survival-Prediction
Predict if a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
Goal: Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow — from data exploration to model tuning and performance improvement.

🎯 Goal

To predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Type: Binary Classification

Input: Passenger information (age, class, gender, fare, etc.)

Output:

1 → Survived

0 → Not Survived

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains passenger details including:

Pclass – Ticket class

Sex – Gender

Age – Age of passenger

SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch – Number of parents/children aboard

Fare – Ticket fare

Embarked – Port of embarkation

Name – Used for extracting titles (feature engineering)
